# Session 1: Repository Setup

**Date**: 2024-12-04
**Duration**: ~45 min
**Spike**: None (infrastructure)

## What Was Accomplished

1. Created triple-track learning repository structure:
   - Elixir/BEAM fundamentals
   - Claude Code context management
   - Git/GitHub for open source contribution

2. Established context persistence architecture:
   - `CLAUDE.md` - auto-loaded project context
   - `progress.json` - structured state (JSON to resist modification)
   - `.claude/learning-path.json` - full curriculum
   - `.claude/sessions/` - session summaries
   - `.claude/commands/` - custom slash commands

3. Created `/begin` and `/end` commands for deterministic session workflow

4. Documented core philosophy in `philosophy.md`

## Key Insight

Human asked: "Why 'likely'? Is there any way to have this behavior occur deterministically?"

This revealed: An LLM writes from current context, not from the perspective of a future stateless instance. The human can audit the system from outside; the LLM only operates within it. This asymmetry is the foundation for the architecture.

Changed `CLAUDE.md` from descriptive ("here's what should happen") to imperative ("DO THIS FIRST when user says X").

## Decisions Made

- **TideWave**: Deferred to spike 17 (after Phoenix intro)
- **BAML/TOON**: Evaluated, not using (our state files are small)
- **Git workflow**: Per-spike branches, merge to main when complete
- **Checkpoint granularity**: Per spike (not per concept)

## What's Next

- Spike 01: Elixir basics (IEx, types, atoms, strings)
- Test `/begin` command in fresh session

## Questions/Gaps

- Will `/begin` behave deterministically? (To be tested)
- Session summary format - is this the right structure?
